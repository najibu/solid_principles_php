# SOLID Principles in PHP

SOLID represents a series of guidelines that developers can use to, if done well, simplify and clarify their code. While certainly not laws, understanding these concepts will make you a better developer.

## SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility <br />
The most popular of the SOLID design principles, the single responsibility principle dictates that a class should have only one reason to change.
<br />

2. Open-Closed <br />
This is one of those principles that developers often skip over. Don't! These techniques are paramount to mature design.
<br />

3. Liskov Substitution <br />
Coined by Barbara Liskov, this principle states that any implementation of an abstraction (interface) should be substitutable in any place that the abstraction is accepted.
<br />

4. Interface Segregation <br />
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use. As you'll find, this all comes down to knowledge.
<br />

5. Dependency Inversion <br />
There's a common misunderstanding that "dependency inversion" is simply another way to say "dependency injection." However, the two are not the same.
